# TODO

- Add buttons should be small, inline and to the right of the Resources/Projects buttons in the subject expanded view
- The expanded view should have the following:
  - Subject Name
  - Short summary
  - Co/prerequisites & recommended
  - Goal
  - Resources
  - Projects
  - Notepad
- The Goal textbox should be inline and to the right of the Goal header in the subject and project expanded views
- In-Progress subjects on the dashboard should have a modified expanded view all the time
  - Two/One subject columns rather than three
  - Projects should also be in the expanded view on the dashboard
- Fix project functionality in the subject card
  - Icon in the checkbox should be removed
  - Checkbox should work to toggl project progress(currently doesn't)
  - Clicking the project card should bring up the expanded project view
- Project resource x-buttons should be in the same location no regardless of link vs text
- Dashboard and Catalog links should be right-justified
- Remove | between polymathica and Dashboard/Catalog
- Add data import/export feature
- Add reset-all button (include danger warning, must type in "Polymathica")
- Add subject creation feature
  - Include AI-generated short subject summaries

## Done

- Fix resources being unaddable in projects
  - Resource adding modal appears below project modal
  - Resources don't get assigned to projects correctly
- Brainstorm with Claude a way to host on Github Pages or something similar, with a non-editable, less-detailed view I can share with other people and a view for me that it how it is now, ie. editable.
  - Likely need to rework data storage, especially with user-editable subjects.
